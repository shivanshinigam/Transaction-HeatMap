## How It Works

### 1. **Input Data**
The application expects transaction data in the following format:
json
[
  
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "transactionType": "credit" | "debit",
    "amount": Number
  
]

## Data Processing
Grouping by Date: Transactions are grouped by their date using the groupByDate utility.
Net Transaction Calculation: For each date group, the net transaction amount is calculated using getNetTransactions.
Heatmap Coloring: Each day's net amount determines the heatmap cell color via getHeatmapCellColor.


## Visualization
The data is displayed in a heatmap format.
Tooltips provide detailed information about the day's transactions

🦾Customization
Update Heatmap Color Ranges
To modify the thresholds or colors for the heatmap:

Open transactionUtils.js.
Edit the ranges in the getHeatmapCellColor function.
Adjust corresponding CSS classes in App.css.
